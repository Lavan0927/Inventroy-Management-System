# Inventroy-Management-System
A small software to handle the inventory of the New Building at the Department of Industrial Management

This project is aimed at developing a desktop-based application named Inventory Management System for managing the inventory system of the New Building at the Department of Industrial Management. The Inventory Management System (IMS) refers to the system and processes used to manage the stock of the department with the involvement of a technology system. This system can be used to view the details of the available inventory, enter new items into inventory, update the existing inventory, and remove items from the inventory. It is a small window-based application that has an admin component to manage the inventory and maintenance of the inventory system.
